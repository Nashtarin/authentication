# Sunshine Hospital

You can go to my website by clicking here [Sunshine Hospital](https://sunshine-hospital.web.app/).


I made a website for a hospital named as Sunshine Hospital.People can easily know about the hospital by visiting my site as I depicted different services, facilities in the project
* In header I created some routes so that user can experience different pages and also there are sign in and sign up options.
* User can signin in two different ways,first by giving email and Password(prior to this a new user must sign up him/herself) and another one is by google email sign in.
* In home page I showed different services in short, in every service there is a details button by clicking this user can find the detail of that particular service but to know the detail user must be logged in first
* The website also has doctors and packages pages and they are protected, a user should sign in first to visit there.
* If any protected page asked for login and after successful login the website automatically redirected to the page where he/she was
* When user signed in with google or email/password,they will be redirected to the page where they were
* I used react,bootstrap mainly to make this site.
